♟️ Chess AI Project

This repository hosts a Chess AI, developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
The project aims to build an artificial intelligence capable of playing chess with a pre-trained neural network and a custom chess engine.

✨ Features

🧠 Chess Engine – Core logic for AI’s chess moves & game management

🤖 Pre-trained Model – chess_model_2018_02_fast.h5 for move prediction & evaluation

📊 Data Preparation – Scripts to preprocess and prepare training datasets

📒 Interactive Development – Jupyter Notebook for experimentation, visualization & analysis
